This is a work in progress.

Getting the .Net SDK installed:

1. Install git:   pkg install git
2. Clone the ports repo:   git clone https://git.freebsd.org/ports.git /usr/ports  (will take a bit)
4. CD to the .Net ports dir:  cd /usr/ports/lang/dotnet
5. Build/install:  make install clean (will take a bit)
