This is a work in progress.

DO NOT ATTEMPT ON A SLOW/LOW RAM MACHINE OR YOU WILl REGRET YOUR DECISION !

I am building on a Dell Precision Mobile Workstation with 98GB RAM and a 11th Gen Inntel i7-11850H with 8 cores and it still takes an hour+ !

Getting the .Net SDK installed:

1. Install git:   pkg install git
2. Clone the ports repo:   git clone https://git.freebsd.org/ports.git /usr/ports  (will take a bit)
4. CD to the .Net ports dir:  cd /usr/ports/lang/dotnet
5. Build/install:  make install clean (will take a bit)
   A. First you will see a long download
   
   B. You will then be presented with 2 dialog boxes in succession. Accept the defaults on both by hitting the Enter key.
   
   C. Wait through the long build process.
   
   D. You'll see a "gnugrp-3.11" dialog box.  Accept the defaults by hitting Enter.
   
   E. "krb5-____" dialog box. Accept the defaults by hitting Enter.
   
   F. "gmake____"  same as above for all of these.
   
   G. "m4____" 
   
   H. "texinfo_____"  
   
   I. "help2man_____"  
   
   J. "p5-Locale-libintl__"
   
   K. "autoconf___" 
   
   L. "automake___" 
   
   M. "node20__" 
   
   N. "c-ares"
   
   O. "ninja"
   
   (at this point I'm wondering if I am doing things the "hard way", lol)
   
   It will look like it is looping on "SOURCE_BUILD_SDK_DIR_ARCADE_SHARED_FX_SDK" but wait and eventually it will finish.
   
6. When you get the prompt back, type dotnet --version and you should see some output that looks like "8.0.106".
7. Follow the "KDE Wallet" instructions in this repo.

Getting an IDE setup:

As much as I dislike Electron apps in general, the easiest choice here seems to be VSCode.
Install it with: pkg install vscode
