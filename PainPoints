Currently (August 7th, 2024),I cannot find a way to install "C# Dev Kit for Visual Studio Code" in VSCode on FreeBSD.
That said, I am new to VSCode, I've always used Visual Studio, so perhaps there is something I am just not grokking.

Things that I'm experiencing that are different than Visual Studio:
1. Intellisense isn't acting very intelligent.  Either I get too many entries or none at all.
2. You can't just set a "Startup" project and hit the "play" button to start the app.
3. In fact, there are no toolbar buttons at all.
