NOTE - You don't need to do this step unless you are running in a VMWare Workstation guest.

How to install open-vmware-tools and configure Xorg:
1. pkg install open-vm-tools
2. pkg install xf86-video-vmware
3. sysrc vmware_guestd_enable="YES"

This will get you clipboard integration with the host, drag and drop and auto screen resizing.

What's missing:  Mouse integration.  You'll have to hit ctrl+alt to leave the VM.

Text copy & paste in UI as well as DND
are impacted by Xorg changes that do not allow
the vmmouse driver to be associated with the X11 screen.
