# FreeBSDDotNetGuide
A guide to setting up a .Net development environment on  FreeBSD

This guide is for .Net Developers.  It assumes you know enough to get FreeBSD installed but are generally unfamiliar with FreeBSD as a development platform.

What's here:
- How to get a .Net development environment on FreeBSD.  Those are the numbered steps.
- How to host a .Net web application in a Jail on FreeBSD. https://github.com/AZDeveloper777/FreeBSDDotNetGuide/blob/main/BastilleJail_w_DotNet_MVC.md
- How to host a Git server on FreeBSD that you can use with VSCode and Visual Studio as your remote repo.  https://github.com/AZDeveloper777/FreeBSDDotNetGuide/blob/main/HostGitOnFreeBSD.md
- Assorted tips, tricks, thoughts and musings from the perspective of a Windows / .Net developer on moving to FreeBSD an application delivery platform and development environment.  I'm a long time VMWare Workstation user, so you'll see some of that, too.
