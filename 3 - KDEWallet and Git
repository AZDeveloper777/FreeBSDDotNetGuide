Naturally, you'll need Git
pkg install git

You will need to setup a KDE Wallet for GitHub interoperability
1. pkg install gnupg
2. gpg --full-generate-key (use defaults)
3. gpg-connect-agent /bye   (this verifies GPG agent is running)
4. export GPG_TTY=$(tty)  (sets your GPG TTY environment variable)
